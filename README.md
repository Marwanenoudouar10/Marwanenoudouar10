# Hi there, I'm Marwane 👋

I'm a Flutter mobile developer based in Casablanca, Morocco, with a passion for building intelligent, scalable applications that bridge mobile experiences with cutting-edge technologies. Currently, I'm crafting multi-tenant employee benefits platforms at Tandeem, where I combine mobile development expertise with backend systems, AI integration, and robust architecture patterns to create solutions that truly make a difference.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in full-stack mobile application development, but my interests and skills extend far beyond just building UIs. I work across the entire technology stack, from designing intuitive Flutter interfaces to architecting backend APIs, integrating AI capabilities, managing complex database systems, and ensuring secure, performant applications. I'm particularly drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of multiple technologies, where mobile apps need to communicate with intelligent backend systems, process real-time data, and provide seamless experiences across diverse user needs.

## 🔭 Current Focus

At Tandeem, I'm leading the development of sophisticated mobile solutions that involve fascinating technical challenges like implementing dynamic multi-tenant customization, creating flexible authentication flows that adapt to different client configurations, and building systems that seamlessly integrate with various backend services. I'm working extensively with internationalization, supporting French, English, and Arabic with proper RTL layouts, building applications that truly serve a global audience.

My work requires juggling multiple database technologies depending on the use case. I use Hive for efficient local storage in Flutter apps when I need lightning-fast access to structured data without network overhead. SQLite powers offline-first capabilities in mobile applications where users need to work regardless of connectivity. For backend systems, I work with MySQL for traditional relational data and have experience with Oracle databases in enterprise environments. I've also adopted Supabase as a modern alternative to Firebase, appreciating its PostgreSQL foundation and real-time capabilities.

Beyond production mobile apps, I've architected and built AI-powered chatbot systems using Python and FastAPI, integrating technologies like sentence transformers for natural language understanding, FAISS for efficient vector search, and Google's Gemini API for intelligent conversational experiences. This work taught me how to bridge the gap between traditional application development and modern AI capabilities, creating systems that feel intelligent while remaining reliable and maintainable.

I'm also deepening my knowledge in areas that have always fascinated me: cybersecurity and reverse engineering. I approach these as intellectual challenges, opportunities to understand systems at their deepest levels and think like both the builder and the attacker. My foundation in C gives me insight into how software works at the memory and processor level, which informs how I think about performance and security even when working in higher-level languages.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning & Exploring

Technology never stands still, and neither do I. Right now, I'm diving deeper into Docker and container orchestration, modernizing how we think about deployment and development environments. I'm exploring advanced Flutter state management patterns and dependency injection to build even more maintainable and testable applications. My networking fundamentals serve me well as I investigate how distributed systems communicate efficiently and securely.

I'm also experimenting with ways to integrate AI capabilities more deeply into mobile applications, exploring how features like on-device machine learning and intelligent caching can create experiences that feel magical while remaining performant and privacy-conscious. My experience with various database systems, from lightweight Hive and SQLite to enterprise-grade Oracle, gives me the flexibility to choose the right tool for each specific challenge.

## 🎯 Beyond Code

When I'm not building software, you'll find me gaming, creating content for YouTube, streaming, or diving into anime and movies. I'm fascinated by how technology shapes entertainment and community. These interests aren't separate from my development work—they inform it. Understanding user engagement through gaming, storytelling through media, and community building through streaming all make me better at creating applications that people actually want to use.

I'm also nurturing business interests, exploring import businesses and entrepreneurship. This business mindset influences how I think about software development—not just as writing code, but as creating value and solving real problems for real people in sustainable ways.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

Some areas where I've built real expertise through hands-on work include clean architecture implementation in Flutter applications with proper separation of concerns across presentation, domain, and data layers. I have experience with multi-tenant system design where single codebases serve multiple clients with different configurations, which requires careful architectural planning and flexible data modeling.

My database experience spans the full spectrum from local mobile storage using Hive and SQLite for offline-first applications, to backend relational databases like MySQL and Oracle for enterprise data management. I understand when to use each technology based on access patterns, data consistency requirements, and scalability needs.

I've implemented real-time communication using WebSocket and Socket.IO for features like live notifications and collaborative experiences, which requires handling complex asynchronous programming and state synchronization across clients. My chatbot work involved vector search implementation using FAISS for semantic similarity, demonstrating understanding of both the algorithms and practical integration challenges.

I work with various backend platforms including FastAPI for modern Python APIs, integration with Odoo for ERP functionality in business applications, and experience with both Firebase and Supabase for real-time backend services. I design and integrate APIs that connect mobile frontends with complex backend services, ensuring robust error handling and efficient data transfer.

My internationalization work goes beyond simple string translation, implementing proper localization and RTL support for truly global applications that feel native to users regardless of their language or cultural context.

## 📫 Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers, discussing technical challenges, or exploring collaboration opportunities. Whether you want to talk about Flutter architecture, AI integration in mobile apps, database design strategies, system security, or just exchange ideas about building great software, I'd love to hear from you.
